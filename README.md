# My vimrc File

This is the vimrc file I use.
Vundle is used to manage Plugins.

## Installation

1. Download Vundle:
   git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

2. Put the **'vimrc'** file on the home directory as **'.vimrc'**

3. Open vim and install plugins:
   :PluginInstall

## Tip

This vimrc file works better on GVIM.
